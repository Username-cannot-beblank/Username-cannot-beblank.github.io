    <p> The Nintendo DS was released in 2005 and is Nintendo’s highest selling console at the time of writing with 154 million units sold. With its high amounts of sales, the DS has taken on many revisions, such as the DS Lite, DSi and the DSi XL. The device sports 2 screens, with the bottom being a touch screen. It also was the first of Nintendo’s consoles to have proper internet capabilities and “Download Play,” a service where some games could send downloadable versions of itself to temporarily be used by other systems without the game card for multiplayer sessions.</p>

One thing the DS did well was managing to be accommodating to casual players and hardcore gamers alike with a massive variety of games and software available for the platform. Some of the more casual-oriented software include Brain Age, Cooking Guide and Nintendogs, and some of the more proper videogames includee Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros and Pokemon Black and White.

    <p> With its popularity, the DS unsurprisingly had an action replay release for it, but that’s just a footnote compared to what else happened with the DS. R4 carts are the main attraction in the world of Nintendo DS Homebrew. R4 Cartridges (pictured on the right) are DS Carts that have a microSD card slot in them. On this SD card, you put files that the DS can run and once inserted into the DS, it would allow you to use any program. These things were used to run unofficial copies of games, including region-locked and ROM-hacked games, alongside homebrew, which is software that is made and coded for certain systems by fans and third-party developers.</p>

    <p> Alongside the DS is the original Wii, releasing a year later in 2006. The Wii is one of Nintendo's most iconic and well-known systems to date. It, like the DS, also appealed to the “casual gamer” market and had a wide selection of games and accessories to do so. The Wii had a large library of games, and while some of it is known to be of questionable quality, the system still has many great offerings. Mario Kart Wii, Zelda: Skyward Sword, Wii Sports and Wii Fit are examples.  </p>

With the Wii’s popularity, many people were interested in hacking the console. And in the current day, there are numerous ways of doing so. The most popular method is by simply putting a special file on an SD card and opening a message on the Wii Message Board, But there are options for just USB devices, Other regions and even a method that doesn’t require any external storage at all.

       The main attraction is The Homebrew Channel. This software will allow you to boot any Homebrew developed by fans. <br><br>
       The Wii had (and still does) a massive modding community. It had many things unofficially coded for it like emulators, tech demos, mod patchers, game ripping tools, game launchers, utilities and so much more made for it.
