    <p> One of my personal favourites – The 3DS. It came out in 2011 and had a rough start. The console initially launched with a lacklustre library and a high price, but eventually picked up some steam and became decently successful. The 3DS has many versions that were available, that being the 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, New 3DS, New 3DS XL and the New 2DS XL. Over its life it got a respectable library, with some games including Mario Kart 7, Fire Emblem Awakening, Mario 3D Land, Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.</p>

      The 3DS has a large hacking community for it, and it has a rich history. At first, there was ‘Gateway’ something similar to the R4 carts for the original DS. It used an exploit within the 3DS’s original DS backwards-compatibility mode, but all it really was used for is piracy. 
      <br> 
      A bit later, The first main jailbreaking exploit that surfaced for the 3DS utilised a game known as “Cubic Ninja.” This game was put together so poorly that with a scan of a custom QR code within the game would overload the system and allow custom code to be executed, force-booting the system into the homebrew launcher. The scene would continue to grow and find easier exploits, leading to the current method of manipulating the in-built internet browser.

      The 3DS's homebrewing community has accompished many feats with this handheld. There has been many emulators built for the 3DS, like mGBA and SNES9x. 
      <br>
      Some games have been ported to the 3DS, like Diablo I, Doom, Sonic Mania and the original Super Mario 64.
      <br>
      Many games on the 3DS have a substantial modding community, like Mario Kart 7's CTGP7 project and the 3DS Minecraft port.
      <br>
      Many utilities and quality-of-life improvements have been made for the the 3DS, like the Rosalina menu, Restoring the online play in games with Pretendo, Removing region locking on games and romFS patching.

      The Wii U is the 2012 successor to the Wii and featured the “GamePad”, a tablet-like controller paired to the console, with a design comparable to the Nintendo Switch. The console struggled badly for a variety of reasons, with an underwhelming launch line-up and abysmal marketing being major reasons. Regardless, the Wii U is another one of my personal favourites and has a fairly solid library of games to back it up. The Wii U has many great games on offer, like Maio Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Super Mario Maker, HD remakes of the GameCube Zelda titles, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Super Mario 3D World and Splatoon. Many of these games have since been ported to the Switch, becoming massive hits on the more popular system.    </p>

      While the Wii U doesn’t have as big of a homebrew community as the Wii and 3DS, it still is well-established and has achieved many impressive feats. The exploit that is used to jailbreak the console uses the web browser, like the current method for 3DS. Once the exploit is done, you load into custom firmware environments. The most recent of these is known as Aroma.

      There have been many achievements attained with the Wii U. Some of them include Restoring discontinued online services, Adding plugins like Screenshotting, streaming and game patching, menu customization and disabling region-locking. Many games also have their own small modding communities, like Smash Wii U and Mario Kart 8.
