    <p> The fan-favourite console, the Nintendo GameCube was released in 2002 for Australia and Europe. As a member of the sixth generation of consoles, it sold poorly compared to newcomer Microsoft’s original Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation 2. Regardless of its unideal sales, the GameCube is seen as one of Nintendo’s best consoles. It sports an iconic “lunchbox-like” design, a controller that many love to this day and an amazing lineup of games such as Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Metroid Prime and Luigi’s Mansion.

To fill the temporary game-modifying market on the GameCube, a company known as Datel released the “Action Replay.” The Action Replay works in a similar way that the previously mentioned devices did. However, instead of just using the code-entry method, it utilised pre-installed codes to choose from in a list. When choosing a cheat, you would then do a “stop-and-swap” method by removing the AR disc and then inserting the chosen game. The Action Replay was also capable of forcing the GameCube to launch games that were region-locked, or even Homebrew developed for it by fans.

  <p>	Releasing in 2001, The Game Boy Advance is the 32-bit successor to the original Game Boy and Game Boy Colour. The console is commonly referred to as a portable SNES and its library certainly lives up to that title fairly well with many holding up today. Some of these games include the Mario Advance series, Pokémon Emerald, Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga and Zelda: Minish Cap.

	In the modding scene, the GBA did get an Action Replay, doing what you would expect from these kinds of devices. But these are not the GBA’s most notable feature in the world of modding. Especially compared to the ROM hacking community. Many games in the GBA’s library have dedicated communities of fans who take the original game and modify it. Some edit the game to change the experience (like translations or quality of life improvements) all the way to using the original game as an engine and turning it into an entirely new game. The Pokémon community is well known for making ROM hacks of the franchises’ games on the GBA, and others like the Fire Emblem community follow suite.
