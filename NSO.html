      The Nintendo Switch released in 2017 and is still in support 8 years later.
      As most probably know, the Switch is a hybrid console - both a handheld an a home console. The Switchhas sold over 150 million units, and is the third best-selling video game console as of writing.
      The Switch has a large and high-quality library of games on offer. Super Mario Odessey, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are just some examples.

      The Switch is notably harder to hack then the previous consoles. As it is still in support, Nintendo is still patching and updating the system as of writing.
      Because of this, there is a higher barrier to entry, requiring either an extremely hard hardware exploit on early Switch models,
      or just intalling a modchip into the system. Modding a Switch seems to have similar perks to the Wii U, with modding games, plugins and custom homebrew. 
      Unlike the previous consoles, I personally haven't modded mine due to the barrier to entry, and thus don't have much of an idea as to how it works.

      The Switch 2 is the original Switch's successor and came out in 2025. It has very similar features to the Switch with only minor deviations. 
      It hasn't had anything happen to it in the modding scene yet due to two main factors, the console being less then a year old, and 
         Nintendo's policy where they can render a Switch 2 console useless if it detects any unauthorised modifications. 
         Currently, there hasn't really been much happening with the Switch 2 homebrew-wise.
