<p>The NES Launched in Europe in 1986 and in 1987 in Australia. Its impact cannot be understated as the console is commonly pointed toward as the saviour of home-console gaming after the video game crash of 1983. Housing such iconic games on it like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Capcom’s Mega man franchise, the Nintendo Entertainment System was smash hit sales-wise and has left an undeniable impact on the gaming scene to date. The system had a large library of games and accessories released like ROB the robot, the Power Glove and the NES Zapper among others.
<br><br>
	Because of the console’s sales and popularity, third parties of course wanted a piece of the NES pie. Outside of third-party games and accessories for the console, Some companies made unofficial modification devices with the main one being Game Genie. The basic gist of the device is that you put your game cartridge into the Game Genie, then inserted it into the NES. Once the NES boots, you are presented with a code entry screen. Input a code into the device and it will run your game of choice... but it will be modified in some way. In games like Super Mario Brothers, these codes were used to make you invincible, have infinite lives or start in different levels. While explaining how this works technically will be too long and complicated to go into here, it was definitely a method that worked well and was profitable enough to have versions and variations from other companies made for other consoles like the Game Boy, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, SEGA Genisis, Game Boy Advance, DS, GameCube and many more.

<p>The Game Boy released in September 1990 in Europe. As one of the first handheld consoles, it had a great game library, battery life and price, leading it to be a big success. While it shows its age, it still was impactful in many ways. It was the birthplace of some well-known franchises, most notably the Pokémon franchise. Later in its life the Game Boy Colour released. While many debate whether the system was its own console or just a revision (Like the New 3DS or Switch OLED), It really was just a slightly beefier Game Boy with a colour display. 
<br><br>

Once again, the large system user base led third parties to be attracted to the thing like the NES. Because of this, the Game Genie had a version made for the system. It wasn’t anything too special, it worked the same as the NES version with the codes and stuff.

<p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is the successor to the NES, launching in the year of 1992 for Europe and Australia. This 16-bit console may not have sold as well as its predecessor, but still was large success. The library of games available for the console was high in both numbers and quality. From well-known bestsellers like Super Mario World, Yoshi’s Island and Zelda: Link to the Past, to more obscure gems like SimCity, Mario Paint and Fire Emblem IV: Genealogy of the Holy War, many SNES games still hold up to this day.

History likes to repeat itself, and that can't be more true with the game modification scene as who’s surprised – a game genie released for the SNES as well, functioning in the same way the OG did. The main interesting thing here is that Nindo actually tried to take legal action against the device’s manufacturers but was ruled in Game Genie’s favour. 
<br><br>
One more thing that happened in the third-party scene was the introduction of the “backup devices”. Put simply, it was a device that took the SNES game and ripped it, making a ROM image of the game for sharing and copying. wHile useful for preservation of SNES games, at the time all it really did was support piracy.

<p>
  	The Nintendo 64 was a home console that did full 3D graphics, gaining its name from the fact that it is a 64-bit console. While the original Sony PlayStation outsold it, the N64 was still very impactful on gaming as we know it. By far the most well-known impact is the game Super Mario 64, the first fully 3D game. It revolutionized both the platforming genre and sold very well. The N64 library has not aged as well as the SNES due to this being a transitional period for gaming from 2D to 3D, the console still hosts its fair share of classics. Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, Kirby 64, F-Zero X and Rare Ware’s Banjo-Kazooie are some examples.
<br><br>
    Breaking the pattern established for the previous consoles mentioned, Game Genie did not release on the 64 and I cannot discern why. The market was not completely devoid of these game-editing devices though, as two others stepped up to make said products. The GameShark and the Action Replay. Both these things do something similar to what the Game Genie had done.

<P>
  The virtual Boy was a “portable” console made in 1995, between the N64 and the SNES. It tried to do something comparable to Virtual Reality but really didn’t work out. Having a completely red display, it was notoriously ugly to look at and was very uncomfortable to play, leading it to be labelled as a health risk. It sold about 770 thousand copies and only had 22 games made for it, becoming Nintendo’s worst selling product ever.
  <br><br>
  The reason why I bring it up here is to show that even this clunky piece of technology has a fanbase. This thing has fan-made homebrew games and even a fan-made link cable (something that never actually released officially). Despite how poorly the thing performed, it still has its fans.
